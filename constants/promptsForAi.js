const promptGallerySchema = (images, galleryLength) => `
You are given a JSON array of all images on a product page, each with all their HTML attributes (with class listed first if present).

**Your task:**
1. Select the image that should be used as the main avatar (profile or primary product photo).
2. Select up to ${galleryLength} images suitable for the gallery.

**Instructions:**
- Only include images in the gallery if they are clearly relevant product photos (e.g., showing the product from different angles or in different contexts).
- Do NOT repeat the avatar image in the gallery, unless absolutely no other product images exist.
- Ignore icons, logos, banners, or decorative/non-product images.
- Base your selection on clues from the class, alt text, filename, image dimensions, and any other attribute.
- For each URL, return the version with all query parameters removed, so that only the base file path remains. The goal is to retrieve the highest quality original image.
If the URL contains a question mark (?), remove the question mark and everything that follows.
Return only the cleaned URLs.

Here is the array of images:
${images}
